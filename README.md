To initiate the chat bot, run the following command in the terminal:

## Server

To start the server: (Port 3000)
```
cd server
npm install
npm run start:dev

```

## Client

To start the client:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run serve
```

it's better to run them on two different console which is more convenient to see the logs.

Enjoy!
