# Chat Bot
____________________

To initiate the chat bot, run the following command in the terminal:

## Server

To start the server: (Port 3000)
```
cd server
npm install
npm run start:dev

```

## Client

To start the client:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run serve
```

it's better to run them on two different console which is more convenient to see the logs.

## Contact with the chat bot
In order to ask questions to the chat bot, you can use the following commands:
```
@chatbot <your question>
IE: @chatbot What is the capital of France?
```
if it has the answer, he will answer you. Otherwise, he will tell you that he doesn't have the answer.

if you want to give him the answer, you can use the following command:
```
@chatbot <your question> <your answer>
IE: @chatbot What is the capital of France? Paris
```

And you might help other people to get the answer to their questions.


Enjoy!
